# Data-analysis-using-statistics-on-the-data-of-student-achievement
Data analysis using statistics on the data of student achievement in secondary education in two Portuguese schools.

In this project I did..
  1) Explored the data type in each column of the dataset.
  3) Explored the range of values in each column in the dataset.
  4) Explored the distribution of each column.
  5) Explored the relationship between the column using correlation matrix.
  6) Ranked all the features affecting the overall grade.

I leanrt about correlation matrix and how to implement it.
